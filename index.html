<h2>MF Portal Semantic Source Demos</h2>
<p><strong><a href="http://danielbaird.com/mf-portal-modern/html-components/old/cat-list.source.html">Original Page</a></strong></p>
<p>This is the HTML currently generated by MF's portal code. To create
this page, I saved the html from a real portal page, split the page's
main &quot;components&quot; up into separate files, and re-assembled.</p>
<p>Note that the page doesn't resize properly.  The original GWT-created
page make everything a fixed pixel size, then uses JavaScript event
handlers to run code when the page size changed, re-calculating and
re-writing all the fixed sizes.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://danielbaird.com/mf-portal-modern/html-components/new/cat-list.source.html">New Page</a></strong></p>
<p>This is the page assembled from the same component files, but with
each component re-written into clean, semantic HTML.</p>
<p>I replaced all the embedded size and styling information in the HTML
with CSS stylesheet rules.  This page has the CSS embedded.</p>
<p>Here, the page resizes correctly just using normal web page behaviour
without using any JavaScript event handlers.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://danielbaird.com/mf-portal-modern/html-components/new/cat-list.source.html">New Page with alternate styling</a></strong></p>
<p>This rather silly example is the identical page -- HTML unchanged --
as the New Page above, but with an alternative CSS stylesheet.
Having a comprehensible page structure allows us to target page
elements with CSS and produce a very different feel without altering
the page content at all.</p>
