# Modernisation of MediaFlux Portals functionality

[MediaFlux](http://www.arcitecta.com/Products) includes a Portals
plugin that allows users to create web sites to access their data.

MediaFlux uses [GWT](http://www.gwtproject.org/) to create the
Portal pages.  GWT is a reasonable choice for producing
desktop-application-like web pages, but the HTML generated by
GWT is very resistant to styling via CSS.  CSS is the standard way
of formatting web content.

This project aims at re-imagining Portal output as clean, sensible
HTML.
